# Eisenhower Matrix Instructor Notes

## Exploring the Repo

Before we start coding, let's explore the project:

- in the `.vscode` directory there are some recommended extensions
- we can create a `terminals.json` there to include a script that automatically starts docker
- there is a `docker-compose.yml` file that defines the services we will need later
- utilities are in the `packages` folder, the app is in `apps`
- the slides are also included in the monorepo
